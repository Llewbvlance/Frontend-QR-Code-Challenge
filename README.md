### What I learned

In this challenge I was reminded of the infamous we development quib: how to centre a div. I achieved this by setting my body height to 100vh, which worked perfectly for this specific project. 

### Continued development

Going forward, I am looking to cement certain fundamentals so that challenges such as these become second nature. I look forward to seeing my fundamentals solidified through practice and projects. I believe that the key to being great atanything is by having the basics down to perfection!
